<h2 class="about-header">The Story...</h2>

<div class="mission-statement larger-font">
  My name is Dan Van Atta, I'm a professional software engineer, and coded WNC Supply Sites
  after volunteering in the Asheville area for hurricane relief. This site started out as a shared
  spreadsheet to simply identify site surpluses, then turned into a database to match site needs
  and surpluses. From there, a website was born.
</div>
<div class="mission-statement larger-font">
  The work done at distribution sites is just amazing. But overwhelming. Very overwhelming. At one distribution
  site, I was sorting and helping with supplies and was pointed to a mountain of hand sanitizer. My dad described
  how supply sites were operating to me before I started volunteering, that supply sites were sharing supplies and
  redistributing them. I asked the logistics manager at the donation site if they were in communication with
  other supply sites: "not really."
</div>
<div class="mission-statement larger-font">
  I felt desperation, how do we redistribute surpluses from supply sites to where those supplies are needed?
  How do we increase the effectiveness of supply sites, so existing supplies can be used? How do we increase
  the effectiveness of supply workers, pulling 12 hour shifts 7 days a week, short on labor and impacted by
  Hurricane Helene themselves?
</div>

<div class="mission-statement larger-font">
  My hope is that wnc-supply-sites will help. A super simple interface for managing supplies, what is too much,
  what is needed, and a way to connect supply sites to one another and to supply hubs.
